# Angular 2 Recipe (ng2-recipe)
##### Built with ES6+, Webpack, TypeScript, Bootstrap (Material Design Theme)

I understand that getting started is hard. Thats why I created this jumpstart project, to provide a simple way to get started with Angular 2.

Here you will find examples about:

- Components and subcomponents
- Form handling (including basic validation)
- Services (http)
- Observables (RxJS)
- Using and creating directives
- Using and creating pipes 
- Router configuration

## Getting Started

* Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dfernandeza/ng2-recipe
cd ng2-recipe
```

* Install all the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

* Start the project:
```bash
npm start
```
_This will start the project with development mode on (with source maps enabled)_

* Start hacking
